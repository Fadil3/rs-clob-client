High Impact, Low Effort

1. Discord/Telegram Alerts 🔔
What: Get a phone notification the instant an arbitrage is executed.
Why: You don't have to stare at logs. Sleep peacefully knowing the bot will ping you.
Effort: ~30 lines of code (HTTP POST to webhook).

2. Auto-Settle Winning Positions 💰
What: When a market resolves (e.g., "Trump Wins"), the bot automatically claims your winnings.
Why: Currently, you have to manually redeem. This closes the loop.
Effort: Medium. Requires monitoring resolved markets + calling redeemPositions on-chain.

3. Profit Dashboard (TUI/Web) 📈
What: A simple terminal UI (using ratatui) or web page showing:
Total Profit/Loss
Open Positions
Recent Trades
Why: Visualization makes it feel real. Also great for screenshots!
Effort: Medium (TUI is faster than building a web frontend).

🥈 Medium Impact, Medium Effort

4. Cross-DEX Arbitrage 🌉
What: Compare Polymarket prices against other prediction markets (Kalshi, Manifold, etc.).
Why: Sometimes Polymarket has "Trump @ $0.48" while Kalshi has "Trump @ $0.52". Free money.
Effort: High (Need to integrate other APIs, handle different settlement mechanics).

5. Smart Position Sizing 🧮
What: Instead of fixed MAX_SPEND, dynamically size based on:
Confidence (how far below 1.0 is the sum?)
Liquidity (can you actually fill?)
Kelly Criterion (optimal bet sizing)
Why: Maximize edge, minimize risk of ruin.
Effort: Medium (Math is well-documented online).

6. Rate Limit Handling & Backoff 🛡️
What: If Polymarket API returns 429 (Too Many Requests), gracefully sleep and retry.
Why: Prevents bot crashes during high-volume events (Election Night).
Effort: Low (Add exponential backoff wrapper).

🥉 Nice-to-Have (Future)
7. Historical Backtest Engine 📜
Store all events to a database. Replay them to test new strategies.
8. Multi-Chain Support ⛓️
Polymarket is on Polygon. Manifold is off-chain. Kalshi is fiat. Unify them.
9. Mobile Companion App (Flutter/React Native) 📱
Control your swarm from your phone.
